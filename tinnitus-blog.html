            <h2 class="blog">What is Tinnitus?</h2>
            <p class="blog">
                Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the ears or head when no external sound source is present. It is
                often described as a ringing, buzzing, or hissing noise and can vary in pitch, volume, and duration.
                Tinnitus affects approximately 15-20% of the population. Various factors, including age-related hearing
                loss, exposure to loud noises, certain medications, and underlying health conditions, can cause it.

            <p class="blog">

                TRT is a highly effective, evidence-based treatment that helps patients manage their tinnitus by
                combining sound therapy and counseling. Our audiologists will work with you to develop an individualized
                treatment plan that meets your unique needs and concerns. Here is a brief overview of the two main
                components of TRT:

                <li class="blog">
                    Sound therapy: Sound therapy aims to decrease tinnitus's prominence by introducing low-level,
                    neutral sounds into your auditory environment. Patients can achieve this through hearing aids or
                    sound generators, which are carefully calibrated to match their specific hearing profile and
                    tinnitus characteristics.

                <li class="blog">
                    Counseling: Our audiologists will provide in-depth information on the neurophysiological mechanisms
                    behind tinnitus and teach you strategies to change your emotional response to the sound.
                    Understanding the underlying causes of tinnitus and learning to view it as a neutral signal, you
                    will be better equipped to manage your symptoms and reduce their impact on your daily life.

            <h2 class="blog">Hearing Aids and TRT</h2>
            <p class="blog">
                For many individuals with tinnitus, hearing loss is a contributing factor. In such cases, hearing aids
                in conjunction with TRT can provide a more comprehensive solution. By addressing both tinnitus and
                hearing loss, patients can experience significant improvements in their overall quality of life. Our
                audiologists will carefully assess your hearing and recommend the most appropriate hearing aids to
                enhance your TRT experience.
