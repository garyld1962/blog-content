        By amplifying sounds and making them clearer, hearing aids can help individuals better understand speech, particularly in noisy environments. This can be a game-changer for those who need help to keep up with conversations or feel left out of social situations. Improved hearing ability can restore social interactions, allowing people to maintain relationships and avoid the feelings of isolation and loneliness that can come with hearing loss.
